        <h1>Assignment 1: Proxy Server</h1>
        <h2>Due: Friday, January 29, 2021, 11:59 PM. In groups of up to 2 students</h2>

        <div class="space"></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p> In this assignment, you will learn about proxy servers, a.k.a., web
        cache. Your task is to develop a small web proxy server which is able to
        cache web pages. It is a very simple proxy server which only understands
        GET-requests, but is able to handle all kinds of objects - not just HTML
        pages, but also images, Javascripts, etc. We will also add some
        unconventional features to our proxy server, such as modifying the HTTP
        responses being returned to the browser. </p>

        <p> Generally, when the client (web browser) makes a request, the
        request is sent to the web server. The web server then processes the
        request and sends back a response message to the requesting client. In
        order to improve the performance, we create a proxy server between the
        client and the web server. Now, both the request message sent by the
        client and the response message delivered by the web server pass through
        the proxy server. In other words, the client requests the objects via
        the proxy server. The proxy server will forward the clientâ€™s request to
        the web server. The web server will then generate a response message and
        deliver it to the proxy server, which in turn sends it to the client. A
        proxy server can also be used to anonymize web surfing. The destination
        server receives requests from the  proxy server, and thus does not
        receive information about the end user's address. </p>

		<p><code>TODO</code>: You may work on this assignment in groups of up
		to 2 people. Try to find a partner (there is a "Search for Teammates!"
		post on Piazza) or decide to work individually. Make sure
		you can login to MarkUs. If you work in a group, create a group on
		MarkUs and invite your partner.</p>

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Getting started: socket programming in Python</h3>

        <p> In this assignment, you will use <strong>Python 3</strong>'s socket
        API to implement the TCP connections used by the proxy server. To get
        started with Python socket programming, please review the TCP
        client/server examples presented at the following link:</p>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://pymotw.com/3/socket/tcp.html">TCP/IP Client and Server - PyMOTW-3</a></p>

        <p>Below is the link to the official documentation of the Python 3 socket library: </p>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html">socket - Low-level networking interface - Python 3.7.2 documentation</a></p>

        <p> Once your are caught up with socket programing, you may start
        completing your tasks in this assignment in the following steps.

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Step 1: Forward HTTP requests and responses without caching</h3>

        <p> First, implement a simple TCP server (on
        <code>localhost:8888</code>) that can receive HTTP requests sent from
        the browser clients. Once an HTTP request is received, your proxy server
        needs to create a new client socket that connects to the destination web
        server, and forward the HTTP request there. Print out the HTTP request
        and take a close look: does it need to be modified before being
        forwarded to the destination? </p>

        <p>After sending the request to the destination web server, you'll
        receive an HTTP response. You'll then forward this response back to the
        browser client so that the requested web page can be displayed in the
        browser. Things to observe and think about here: How many HTTP requests
        are issued in order to retrieve one web page? How do you tell that you
        have received the complete response from the destination? </p>

        <p>Below are some URLs that you can use to test this step. Enter them in
        a web browser (Firefox or Google Chrome) and see whether you're
        getting the expected web page back.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>http://localhost:8888/www.example.org</code> (simple and small)</li>
            <li><code>http://localhost:8888/www.cs.toronto.edu/~ylzhang/</code> (with CSS and Javascript)</li>
            <li><code>http://localhost:8888/www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/</code> (a giant HTML to receive. Thanks, Arnold!)</li>
            <li><code>http://localhost:8888/www.cs.toronto.edu/~ylzhang/csc258/memes.html</code> (one with many images)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your proxy server works correctly for the above test cases, it's a
        very good start!</p>

        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use the private (incognito) mode to visit
        these URLs, and close-reopen the window, to avoid the interference of
        browser caching.</p>

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Step 2: Enable the TCP server to handle simultaneous connections</h3>

        <p>If you haven't done so already, you now need to make your proxy
        server become capable of handling multiple incoming connections at the
        same time. The way to achieve this is to use the
        <code>select.select()</code> method. Below are links to a tutorial
        and the Python documentation. You'll figure it out!</p>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://steelkiwi.com/blog/working-tcp-sockets/">How to Work with TCP Sockets in Python (with Select Example)</a></p>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html">select - Waiting for I/O completion - Python 3.7.2 documentation</a></p>

        <p>Make sure to maintain the select list properly by removing sockets
        from the list whenever they become inactive.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> There are other possible approaches to support
        simultaneous connections (such as multi-threading, forking). However, in
        order to meet the learning expectations of this assignment, you must use
        the <code>select</code>-based approach.</p>

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Step 3: Enable caching</h3>

        <p>Now let's add the cache. For each requested URL, we save their
        response from the destination in a <strong>file on the disk</strong> (so
        the cache persists when we terminate and restart the proxy server). Next
        time the same URL gets requests, we will load the response from the
		corresponding file on the disk rather than creating a connection to the
		destination server. You'll see that this greatly improves the page
		loading speed on the browser side.</p>

        <p>Things to think about in this step: How do we name the cache files,
        i.e., how do convert the URLs into proper filenames? Things
        not to worry about: you don't need to worry about replacement policies,
        i.e., how to evict an item out of the cache when the cache becomes
        "full". We simply assume that we have enough disk space and we never
        need to evict any item.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> To make your program portable, the cache files
        should be located under the current folder (where <code>proxy.py</code>
        is). Your program should NOT rely on the existence of any folder that's
        outside the current folder (e.g., <code>/tmp</code>).</p>

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Step 4: Make cache items expire</h3>

        <p>In this step, we add a parameter that specifies how long a cached
        item stays valid. This parameter is passed to the program as a command
        argument, e.g., <code>python proxy.py 120</code>, which means that the
        cached item expires 120 seconds (2 minutes) after it's created. To
        implement this, you'll need to check the last-modified time of a file
        (using <code>os.path.getmtime()</code>) and compare it with the current
        time (<code>time.time()</code>). If the item expires, you need to fetch
        it from the destination server again and update the cache
        accordingly.</p>

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Step 5: Modify the HTTP response</h3>

		<p>This is a feature that conventional proxy servers don't have: when
		the proxy server sends the web page back to the browser, we want to
		"inject" a notification box to the web page, indicating whether the
		displayed web page is a fresh version or a cached version. We also
		display the timestamp which is the current local time for a fresh copy
		and, for a cached copy, is the time when the item was inserted into the
		cache.</p>

        <p>For example, when you visit
        <code>localhost:8888/www.cs.toronto.edu/~ylzhang/</code>, a fresh
        version of the web page would look like the following:</p>

        <p><img width="90%" src="static/img/a1fresh.png" /></p>

        <p>and a cached version would look like the following:</p>

        <p><img width="90%" src="static/img/a1cached.png" /></p>

        <p>In order to add the notification box, you want to insert the
        following segment of HTML code into somewhere in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
        region of the HTTP response.</p>

        <p><code>&lt;p style="z-index:9999; position:fixed; top:20px; left:20px;
        width:200px; </br>height:100px; background-color:yellow;
        padding:10px; font-weight:bold;"&gt;the text&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

        <p>You may modify the above code a little bit to make it less ugly if
        you'd like, but the code itself (and the length of it) should stay quite
        similar to the above.</p>

		<p>Here is how you can get time string given the timestamp in Python:<br/>
		<code>time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', time.localtime(timestamp))</code>
		</p>

		<p>This step may sound simple but there are some subtle issues that
		you'll need to resolve.</p>

		<p><strong>Issue 1</strong>: When you print out the HTTP response
		received from the destination server, you may notice that the content
		of the web page is unreadable binary data instead of the HTML you'd
		expect. This is because the content is compressed using
		<code>gzip</code> (check the "Content-Encoding" in the response header).
		You need to get the decompressed version of the content in order to
		make the modification, however, as described in the "Requirements"
		section below, you're NOT allowed import the <code>zlib</code> library
		which handles decompression. You need to come up with another solution
		to this without using <code>zlib</code>. <strong>Hint:</strong> read Section 3.5 and Section 14.3 of <a
					   target="_blank"
		href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Issue 2</strong>: After adding the notification box, visit
        <code>localhost:8888/wwww.example.org</code> and look closely: compared
        to the original web page at <code>www.example.org</code>, does your
        proxy-version of the page look like <strong>truncated</strong>, i.e., not
        displaying all the information that should be displayed? If so, you need
        to debug it and fix it.</p>

        <p>Once you finish this step, test the latest version of your proxy
        server using all the URLs listed in Step 1, and make sure they all work
        correctly. Then do even more testing until you're convinced that you have
        the perfect proxy!</p>

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p> Below are some specific requirements your code needs to satisfy just
            so that it can be properly marked by the TA. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Your code must be written in Python 3.</li>

            <li>You are only allowed to have the following import statement in your code:<br/>
                <code>import sys, os, time, socket, select</code><br/>
                No other import statement is allowed.
            </li>

            <li>Your proxy server must be started by a command like the
            following:<br/> <code>python proxy.py 120</code><br/> where 120 is
            the maximum age (in seconds) for an item in the cache, i.e., when
            set to 120, a cached item expires 120 seconds (2 minutes) after it's
            created. <strong>No other action (e.g., creating a folder with a certain
            name) should be required to start the program.</strong> </li>

            <li>The URL entered in the browser to visit a web page via the proxy
                server must be like the following: </br>
                <code>http://localhost:8888/the.web.page/to/visit/</code><br/>
                i.e., the host name must be <code>localhost</code> and the port number must be <code>8888</code>
            </li>

            <li>Your code must work as expected on the Linux lab computers in
                DH-2020 or DH-2026, using Firefox or Chrome as the web browser.
            </li>

            <li>Your proxy server only need to be able to handle <code>GET</code> requests.</li>

            <li>Your proxy server does not need to be able to handle <code>https</code> connections.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Marking</h3>

        <p>Below is the tentative overall marking scheme of this assignment:</p>

        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Step 1 and Step 2: 35%</li>
            <li>Step 3 and Step 4: 35%</li>
            <li>Step 5: 20%</li>
            <li>Coding style and documentation: 10%</li>
        </ul>

		<p><strong>Coding style matters.</strong> Your code must be written in
		a proper style and must be well commented so that anyone else can read
		your code and easily understand how everything works in your code. If
		you don't get to complete all the steps, make a note in your code
		describing what has been done and what has not, and provide any
		information that the TA needs to know to mark your submission.</p>

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Submission</h3>

        <p> You will submit your "<code>proxy.py</code>" (only this one file) by
        using the <strong>web submission interface</strong> of MarkUs. You can
        submit the same filename multiple times and only the latest version will
        be marked, so it is a good practice to submit your first version well
        before the deadline and then submit a newer version to overwrite when
        you make some more progress. Again, make sure your code runs as expected
        on a lab computer. </p>

		<p> Late homework submissions are penalized by 1% for every hour of
		lateness, rounded up, to a maximum of 24 hours. Submissions will no
		longer be accepted 24-hours past the deadline, except for documented
		unusual circumstances.</p>

        <div class="space"></div>
        <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

        <p><strong> Please be reminded that ALL assignment submissions will be
        checked for plagiarism at the end of the term. Make sure to maintain
        your academic integrity carefully, and protect your own work. It is much
        better to take the hit on a lower assignment mark (just submit something
        functional, even if incomplete), than risking much worse consequences by
        committing an academic offence. </strong></p>
